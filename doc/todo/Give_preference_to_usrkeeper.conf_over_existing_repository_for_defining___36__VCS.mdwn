I'm using usrkeeper with hg and I will use git to manage some files under /etc apart from usrkeeper for some reason.

However, after I initialize new git repository as /etc/.git, usrkeeper starts to use git as $VCS contrary to definition in usrkeeper.conf. So I think that definition in usrkeeper.conf should be given priority over existing repository.

The patch is below (from https://github.com/hiraku/usrkeeper/commit/02f6d37e50cacddc9605dcbc5c8844b3f4658d6e ):

I would appreciate your consideration.

Thank you.
